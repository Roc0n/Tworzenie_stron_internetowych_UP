            <h2>A Pioneer in Radioactivity</h2>
            <p>Marie Skłodowska-Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first and only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Born Maria  Skłodowska in Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire.</li>
                <li>Studied physics and mathematics at the Sorbonne in Paris.</li>
                <li>With her husband Pierre Curie, she investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity, a term she coined.</li>
                <li>In 1898, they announced the discovery of two new radioactive elements: polonium (named after her native Poland) and radium.</li>
                <li>In 1903, Marie and Pierre Curie, along with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their research on radioactivity.</li>
                <li>Following Pierre's tragic death, Marie continued her research and in 1911, she received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of polonium and radium.</li>
                <li>During World War I, Curie developed mobile X-ray units to help diagnose injuries on the battlefield.</li>
                <li>Her work laid the foundation for modern nuclear physics and cancer therapy.</li>
                <li>Marie Curie died on July 4, 1934, from aplastic anemia likely caused by her long-term exposure to radiation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Her dedication to science and her perseverance in the face of societal barriers made her an inspiration to generations of scientists, especially women.</p>
